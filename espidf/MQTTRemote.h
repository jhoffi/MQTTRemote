     * If using TLS, this configures the certificate verification. Must be set if using TLS.

     *
     * Example to use the global bundle:
     * ```cpp
     *   #include <esp_rls.h>
     *
     *  .vertification = {
     *    .use_global_ca_store = true,
     *  },
     * ```
     *
     * Then before calling start():
     *
     * ```cpp
     *   mbedtls_ssl_config conf;
     *   mbedtls_ssl_config_init(&conf);
     *   esp_tls_init_global_ca_store();
     * ```
     * Here you have the option to use other TLS implementation like mbedtls or wolfssl.
     *
     *
     * Example how to use letsencrypt (or similary for your own certificates):
     * 1. Download the ISRG Root X1 PEM file from https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem
     * 2. Add in main directory
     * 3. Add `target_add_binary_data(${COMPONENT_TARGET} "isrgrootx1.pem" TEXT)` to your CMakeLists.txt
     *
     * Setup verification as follows:
     * ```cpp
     *   extern const uint8_t isrgrootx1_pem_start[] asm("_binary_isrgrootx1_pem_start");
     *
     *  .vertification = {
     *    .certificate = (const char *)isrgrootx1_pem_start,
     *  },
     * ```
     *
     * If using your own certificate, you might need to set `skip_cert_common_name_check` to true in the verification.
